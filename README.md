# WhetherDawn
Django project for calculating times of sunsets, sunrises and, may be, with weather info.

There must be:

- sunsets;
- sunrises;
- weather info.

*We use simple astronomy formulas to calculate sunrise and sunset time for
any place on the Earth and some more complicated formulas to estimate how
light it will be in determined time.*
